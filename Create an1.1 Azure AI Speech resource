You can use the Speech service by creating either a Speech resource or an Azure AI services resource.

In this exercise, you will create an AI Speech resource, unless you already have a resource that you can use.

In another browser tab, open Azure AI Speech Studio, signing in with your Microsoft account.

Select Settings then Create a resource. Configure it with the following settings:
Name of new resource: Enter a unique name.
Subscription: Your Azure subscription.
Region: Select a supported region.
Pricing tier: Free FO (if available, otherwise select Standard S0).
Resource group: Select or create a resource group with a unique name.
Select Create resource. Wait until the resource has been created and then select Use resource. The Get started with Speech page is displayed.
